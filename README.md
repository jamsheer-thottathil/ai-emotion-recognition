### `yarn install`

in the first time, you have to install all requirements, so :
- react
- react-camera
- tfjs (a portability of tensorflow of javascript, used to launch our AI)

### `yarn run start`

once you have installed all the requirements, you can type this command in the terminal.
With this command, the website is compiled and the terminal will tell you when you will be able to launch it. 
you will be local, so `localhost:3000` will work on your browser

### `yarn run build`

if you want an optimized version of your website, an example of a build is available in the gh-pages branch or this 
repository. It is not necessary if you stay in local.


### `yarn run deploy`
